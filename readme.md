# Welcome to the Random Meal Idea Generator!
## *Created specially for the days when you feel like eating "anything lor"*


The way to use this app is simple: 
1. Select '**Start**' to answer a series of questions to help you narrow down what to eat
2. Click '**Next**' to move on to the next question
3. The result will be displayed after you've answered all questions
4. If nothing matches your preferences, you can opt to randomise the result
5. You may also choose to generate a random at the start instead of going through the questions

Have fun!
